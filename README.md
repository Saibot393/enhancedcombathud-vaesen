An implementation of the [Argon - Combat HUD](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/enhancedcombathud) (by [TheRipper93](https://theripper93.com/) and [Mouse0270](https://github.com/mouse0270)) for the [Vaesen](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/vaesen) system. The Argon Combat HUD (CORE) module is required for this module to work.

This module has varius

Due to licensing i am not able to include official text from the book for the description of the standard actions (flee, wrestle, survey...). The default description of these actions therefore only points to page in the rule book which describes them. Should you wish to customize the description of these actions, you can crate an item (i recommend using a talent) with the name `_argonUI_#ActionID` where `#ActionID` is replaced by the actions id:

- "flee":`Flee`,
- "wrestle":`WPG`
- "survey":`Survey`
- "treat injuries":`TreatInjuries`
- "draw weapon":'DrawWeapon'
- "stand up":'Standup'
- "move":'Move'
- "take cover":'TakeCover'
- "dodge":'Dodge'
- "parry":'Parry'
- "break free":'BreakFree'
- "chase":'Chase'
